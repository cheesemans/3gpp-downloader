# 3gpp-downloader
A downloader for 3gpp specifications (http://www.3gpp.org/specifications/specification-numbering)

## Todo
* Improve robustness of script as there are a couple of places where input isn't validated and
  script might crash.
* Add a flag to specify the output folder, aka, where the downloaded specification will be saved.
