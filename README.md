# 3gpp-downloader
A downloader for 3gpp specifications (http://www.3gpp.org/specifications/specification-numbering)

Currently very naive and not very robust :)

## Todo
* Change default flow to listing specification versions, let user pick from list
  * Should be possible to ovveride by providing specification nr via flag
* Pick a better default download location
